## Planning 

View the [Project Board](https://github.com/awidener3/dm-deck/projects/2) here! Currently the project is being maintained and developed solo.

## Summary

DM Deck is a TTRPG Tool, utilizing the Open Gaming License Version 1.0a (OGL 1.0a), that allows dungeon/game masters to run encounters and battles with an easy-to-use card system. The idea sparked from card games such as Pok√©mon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh, to make the most important information available in the space of a card.

The project is heavily inspired by tools such as D&D Beyond, although it attempts to create a "battle experience" that I have not been able to find on other platforms.

This project was also a personal venture by me to learn MERN concepts that I missed while self-learning and completing my coding education. I didn't fully grasp React and GraphQL, so what better way to learn than to build something! This has definitely grown much larger than I anticipated, but I am happy with the progress I've made and am excited to continue developing it.
